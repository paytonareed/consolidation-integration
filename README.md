# Project Goals
For the Consolidation-Integration Unit I would like to both revisit and improve an old project as well as create a new addition. From the first auditory unit, I plan on improving my soundscape narrative. I plan on addressing some of the comments and implementing the improvement suggestions like adding ading transitions and addressing the background noise. I hope to make the soundscape sound cleaner and more realistic. From the second visual argument unit, I would like to make my poster into a series. I felt with my poster, there was a lot more I would have liked to say, but had to keep it simple and clean to fit best with the medium. I plan on creating one or two more posters to accompany the previous one addressing other aspects of sustainability and climate change. One idea might be to make a visual of one of the pages from my website, at home sustainability actions. If time allows, I could add these one or two new visual images in a flexbox format to my website that already contains the original poster image. Thes improvements and additions would continue to transform and level up each of my projects from all of the units.
